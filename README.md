# Godot Autotile Texture Templater (GATT)

The autotile templates provided with the official godot documentation on [Autotiles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/using_tilemaps.html#autotiles) aren't easy to use because the guide lines have been baked into each tile, requiring lots of editing using a graphics program (such as gimp).  Godot Autotile Texture Templater (GATT) solves this problem by generating templates for use in autotiles.
